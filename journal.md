## Entry: 11/2/2025 - 11/9/2025

### Time Spent
- **Total:** 5 hours and 20 minutes

### Tasks Attempted
1. Build a few Figma Diagrams for home page with different menus open.
2. Group meeting with task assignment decisions
3. Build UI prototype

### Problems Encountered
- **Problem 1:** I didn't really know how to use Figma, so I had to learn how
  - *Attempted solution:* I tried learning it by myself and searching for how to do things as needed.
  - *Outcome:* Resolved
- **Problem 2:** Organizing who would work on what for the week.
  - *Attempted solution:* We discussed and decided who would work on each part
  - *Outcome:* Resolved
- **Problem 3:** Still trying to learn how to write dart code
  - *Attempted solution:* Write code as much as I can, and get help from ai and youtube as needed. I still want to learn how to write dart code, so I carefully read all of the code and look at how it works. I then make changes to the ai's code to make it work exactly how I want it to.
  - *Outcome:* Resolved

### Tasks Completed
- [x] I completed the Figma diagrams for the home page
- [x] Group meeting and task assignments
- [x] Build UI Prototype

### Notes & Reflections
This week I was able to complete some UI diagrams with Figma. Then I was able to build the UI prototype by combining aspects of Jennessy and my Figma diagrams. 

### Next Steps
- [ ] Attend Monday's meeting and decide next steps for the project. I will likely start to connect backend functions to the UI to allow the basic functionality of the app to work.
